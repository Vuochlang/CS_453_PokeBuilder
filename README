Makesure "pokebuilder" does not exist before running the program since server.js will create a database call "pokebuilder" and a collection "pokemon".

Running instructions:
1. Start Mongo Server database i.e.
  - mkdir data
  - mongod -dbpath data
2. Now in project repo run: npm install -d 
3. now run: node server
